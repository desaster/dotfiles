1. my vimrc cheatsheet

    - <F7>              file explorer
    - <L-#>		switch to alternate buffer
    - ;			browse buffers
    - <TAB>		trigger completion
    - <CR>		accept completion
    - gd/gy/gi/gr	goto type/definition/implementation/references
    - K			show definition of current word
    - ]g/[g		next/prev diagnostic (diagnostic being error or warning in code)
    - rn		rename (refactor)
    - <L-a/L-ac/L-qf>	fix action for current line / selected / quickfix
    - if/af		text object of function (e.g. cif)
    - <C-o>		return from visiting definition
    - <L-g>		grep given word
    - <L-j>		grep current word
    - <C-p>		fuzzy find files (<C-o> switches to normal mode)

2. TODO

    - remove path from tabline
    - figure out function definition preview
    - terminal should remove line numbers on opening
    - how to scroll in terminal?
    - plugins.vim has some coc bindings as <space>..., but these conflict with
      leader
    - completion is sometimes case sensitive, e.g. foo.namef... should return NameFI
    - how to do typescript folding?
    - backticks sometimes fuck up {} matching?
    - convert this cheatsheet to a helpfile, or maybe a popup
    - tab only works if there's a space to the left
