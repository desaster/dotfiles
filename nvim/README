1. my vimrc cheatsheet


   - <TAB>              trigger completion
   - <CR>		accept completion
   - gd/gy/gi/gr     goto type/definition/implementation/references
   - K		show definition of current word
   - C-o             return from visiting definition
   - L-g		grep given word
   - L-j		grep current word
   - ;		buffers
   - <C-p>		find files
   - ]g/[g		next/prev diagnostic (diagnostic being error or warning in code)
   - rn		rename (refactor)
   - L-a/L-ac/L-qf	fix action for current line / selected / quickfix
   - if/af		text object of function

2. TODO

   - remove path from tabline
   - figure out function definition preview
   - terminal should remove line numbers on opening
   - how to scroll in terminal?
   - plugins.vim has some coc bindings as <space>..., but these conflict with
     leader
   - completion is sometimes case sensitive, e.g. foo.namef... should return NameFI
   - how to do typescript folding?
   - backticks sometimes fuck up {} matching?
   - convert this readme to helpfile
